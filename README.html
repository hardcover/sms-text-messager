  <h2>SMS Text Messager</h2>

  <p>A mobile and desktop PHP/JS app for groups, with sub and overlapping teams, to send text messages from their web site. Sends SMS at no charge to the sender through mobile carrier gateways for e-mail to SMS. SMS Text Messager detects the user's browser to present an appropriate page format to cell phones and other devices. Use Messager anywhere, for example, to notify team members of a change in practice times or to keep parents informed how the team is doing in a competitive event. Documentation is in the app. Screen shots are available at:</p>

  <p>For maximum portability, Messager runs from Linux and Windows web hosts. The required configuration is common at hosting companies, especially cPanel/CentOS hosts:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>PHP, version 5.3.7 or newer</li>

      <li>PHP Data Objects, PDO for SQLite (php_pdo_sqlite)</li>

      <li>Web server write privileges to the includes directory, which can be located outside the public HTML folders</li>
  </ul>
