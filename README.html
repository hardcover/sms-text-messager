  <p>The SMS Text Messager program runs on servers as configured at many website hosting companies. A cPanel/CentOS web host is most likely correctly configured. Messager also runs under Windows with Apache, PHP, PHP Data Objects, specifically PDO for SQLite (pdo_sqlite), and Apache write privileges for the database directory.</p>
