For maximum portability, SMS Text Messager is a PHP/JS application that runs in
Linux and Windows environments with Apache, PHP, PHP Data Objects, specifically
PDO for SQLite (pdo_sqlite), and Apache write privileges for the database
directory. The configuration is common at web hosting companies, especially
cPanel/CentOS hosts. Messager has not been tested under IIS.

SMS Text Messager detects the user's browser to present an appropriate web page
to cell phones and other networked devices. Use Messager anywhere, for example,
to keep parents informed how the team is doing in a competitive event.
