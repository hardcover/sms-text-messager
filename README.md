The SMS Text Messager program runs on servers as configured at many website
hosting companies. A cPanel/CentOS web host is most likely correctly configured.
Messager also runs under Windows with Apache, PHP, PHP Data Objects,
specifically PDO for SQLite (pdo_sqlite), and Apache write privileges for the
database directory.

SMS Text Messager detects the user's browser to present an appropriate web page
to cell phones and other networked devices. Use Messager anywhere, for example,
to keep parents informed how the team is doing in a competitive event.
