# SMS Text Messager

The original SMS Text Messager was a web app for groups to send SMS text messages from their website at no charge through mobile carrier gateways for e-mail to SMS. The app was obsoleted for the intended purpose by multi-platform messaging apps like BlackBerry Messenger.

Yet, interest in the app did not go away. Inquiries were from people looking for a small program to integrate to an existing app, for example, for machinery to text the people responsible for monitoring and maintaining it. Text messages, apparently, are not going away. Who knew?

So, SMS Text Messager is still here. For easy integration into existing programs, the current version is a ludicrously-simple and small program intended for execution from the command line by an existing app. The inputs to the program are through three argv variables, 1) from, 2) to, and 3) the message. The to address is the cell phone number followed by the appropriate carrier's e-mail to SMS address.
