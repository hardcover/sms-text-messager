The SMS Text Messager program runs on servers as configured at many website
hosting companies. A cPanel/CentOS web host is most likely correctly configured.
Messager also runs under Windows with Apache, PHP, PHP Data Objects,
specifically PDO for SQLite (pdo_sqlite), and Apache write privileges for the
database directory.
