For maximum portability, Messager runs from Linux and Windows web hosts. The required configuration is common at hosting companies, especially cPanel/CentOS hosts: 

* PHP, version 5.3.7 or newer
* PHP Data Objects, PDO for SQLite (php_pdo_sqlite)
* Web server write privileges to the includes directory, which can be located outside the public HTML folders

SMS Text Messager detects the user's browser to present an appropriate web page to cell phones and other networked devices. Use Messager anywhere, for example, to notify team members of a change in practice times or to keep parents informed how the team is doing in a competitive event.
